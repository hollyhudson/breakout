Next commit:
- added normalization to the return off the front wall.


Milestones:


- factor code to break out functionality into functions where logic gets
too long and drawn out.


- Make ball bounce off the actual wall rather than in front of the wall
in a glitchy way.

	+ currently boundary wall is just an integer we're testing to
	see if we went beyond, but it should be a wall we test to see
	if we hit.

- Stop balls from rolling along the ceiling.

- When ball crosses back wall make it buzz (ball-zapper)

- Have bricks destroyed dramatically with particle effects (look in the
Learn tab of the engine)
