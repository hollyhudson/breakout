Next commit:
- added normalization to the return off the front wall.


Milestones:


- factor code to break out functionality into functions where logic gets
too long and drawn out.


- Make ball bounce off the actual wall rather than in front of the wall
in a glitchy way.

	= Need to alter collision/reverse vector code to handle new walls.  Is it reversing vectors enough or can I tweak it to prevent it from rolling along walls, floor, and ceiling?

- Stop balls from rolling along the ceiling.

- When ball crosses back wall make it buzz (ball-zapper)

- Have bricks destroyed dramatically with particle effects (look in the
Learn tab of the engine)
