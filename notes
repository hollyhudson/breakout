Milestones:

Set world gravity to zero.  Did not affect behavior

- factor code to break out functionality into functions where logic gets too long and drawn out.
- enforce constant speed for real.  (How?)
	= look for the normalize node, normalize the vector and multiply by intended velocity (rather than the divide operation).
	= check the physics that is on the materials you are using on the surfaces.
- Make ball bounce off the actual wall rather than in front of the wall.
- Stop balls from rolling along the ceiling.
- Stop balls from stalling out.
- When ball crosses back wall make it buzz (ball-zapper)
